# Instagram Clone
This is an application I built using Mongo, Express, React, Sass, and Redux that clones Instagram. Given that instagram is a massive application, the scope of the project was limited to implementing the specific features of instagram shown below.

The project is deployed and can be seen at:https://instagramwebclone.herokuapp.com/. A note that since the project is deployed on the free tier of Heroku, it will run slowly. 

## Features
- User can register for an account, requiring their email, username, name and password.
